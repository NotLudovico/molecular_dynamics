        ## Assignment

        Perform a simulation of a Lennard Jones crystal with 864 particles. Temperature should be controlled using the Langevin thermostat at temperature T = 2. Try with different values of the friction Î³ (e.g. 0.01, 0.1, 1.0,10.0) and look at the difference in the behavior of the potential energy
