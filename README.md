This repo contains the code i wrote for the course "Advanced Numerical Methods" by Prof. Giovanni Bussi. The marimo notebooks are contained in the `apps/` folder. This is done so i can serve the notebooks as pure apps at [https://notludovico.github.io/molecular_dynamics/] (https://notludovico.github.io/molecular_dynamics/)
